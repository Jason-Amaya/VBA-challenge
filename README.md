The script is designed to run for all worksheets in the given workbook. 
The script first runs through all the given data, identifying each individual ticker, 
annual opening and closing price, and sums each dayâ€™s volume to determine the annual 
total volume. After collecting this data, it is written in an adjacent table. 
This table is then read to determine the greatest percent changes and total volume 
among all the tickers. This process is then repeated for all the worksheets.

The screenshots included in the repository only show the top several rows of each year's
data. Taking screenshots of the output data would require hundreds of photos, and, using
the given script and output shown in the screenshots, the efficacy of the script can be
easily determined.
